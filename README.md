# Wine Analytics Dashboard

### Project Goal
This project is a comprehensive analysis of over 120,000 wine reviews, culminating in a live, **interactive web dashboard** designed to provide data-driven insights for the wine industry. The application transforms raw data into a dynamic tool that can be used for market analysis and strategic decision-making.

### Key Features
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science and application development workflow, showcasing a variety of skills:

* **Interactive Dashboard:** A single-file web application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to filter data by country, variety, and price.
* **Advanced Data Visualization:** The dashboard features multiple, dynamic charts that update in real-time. Key visuals include:
    * A **choropleth map** that visually represents the average wine rating by country.
    * A **pie chart** showing the distribution of wines from top-producing countries.
    * A **histogram** visualizing the overall distribution of wine ratings.
* **Predictive Model:** The dashboard includes a live **Linear Regression model** that predicts a wine's rating based on its price. This demonstrates the ability to turn data analysis into a functional, predictive tool.

### Technical Stack
* **Backend Analysis:** Python (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`) for data cleaning, EDA, and model training.
* **Frontend Development:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
* **Visualization Libraries:** D3.js and Chart.js for creating compelling, interactive charts and the world map.

### Conclusion
This dashboard serves as a powerful portfolio piece that showcases a deep understanding of the full data analysis lifecycleâ€”from data preprocessing and statistical analysis to predictive modeling and the development of a professional, interactive application.
